# TOPIC: Customer Lifetime Value Prediction utilizing Deep Neural Network

### Background:
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is known as an important concept in marketing and management of organizations to increase the captured profitability. Total value that a customer produces during his/her lifetime is named customer lifetime value. Accurate predictions of customers' future lifetime value (LTV) given their attributes and past purchase behavior enables a more customer-centric marketing strategy. Marketers can segment customers into various buckets based on the predicted LTV and, in turn, customize marketing messages or advertising copies to serve customers in these different segments better. 


**Algorithm used**: Deep Neural Network


### Procedure
- Preprocessing the dataset
- Deciding on the loss function and the model architecture
- Train the model
- Inference

### Dataset
- We have selected the ### [Kaggle Acquire Valued Shoppers Challenge Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/acquire-valued-shoppers-challenge/data) as our dataset. The dataset has 350 million rows of anonymous transactions from 300k shoppers.
- The preprocessing of the dataset is as follows:
  + Prepare csv files for top 25 companies with the most transactions.


### Further considerations (TBA)
